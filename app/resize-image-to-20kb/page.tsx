      { heading: "How the 20KB Compressor Works", body: "Select an image and start the compressor. Because 20KB is an unusually small target, ResizeFox tests lower image quality first and reduces the pixel dimensions when quality changes alone are not enough. You can review the final file size before downloading." },
      { heading: "When You May Need a 20KB Image", body: "A 20KB limit is most common on older application portals, exam and recruitment forms, thumbnail fields, and systems designed for slow connections. Small headshots, signatures and simple graphics tend to handle this target better than detailed photographs." },
      { heading: "Tips for a Clearer Result at 20KB", body: "Crop away unused background before uploading and begin with an image that has modest dimensions. Busy textures, noise and large transparent areas require more data, so a clean, tightly framed source usually produces a more readable 20KB file." },

    faqs={[
      { question: "Will my image be exactly 20KB?", answer: "The tool aims for 20KB or below rather than adding data to hit an exact number. The result may therefore be slightly smaller." },
      { question: "Why can a 20KB image look softer?", answer: "Reaching such a small file size often requires both stronger compression and fewer pixels, especially for detailed photos." },
      { question: "Does ResizeFox store my file?", answer: "No. Compression happens locally in your browser, so your image does not need to leave your device." },
