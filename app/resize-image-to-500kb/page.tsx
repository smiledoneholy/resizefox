When a very large source cannot meet the limit through quality adjustment alone, the tool also scales its dimensions." },
      { heading: "Useful for Product Photos and Email", body: "Half a megabyte is often enough for product shots, property photos, portfolio previews and email attachments that need visible detail without the weight of an original camera file. A lighter asset can upload more quickly and consume less recipient bandwidth." },
      { heading: "Choose Quality Based on How the Image Will Be Seen", body: "Inspect fine lines, text and faces after downloading. A 500KB copy may look excellent at normal webpage size but is not a replacement for a full-resolution original intended for printing or extensive editing. Keep the source file as your master copy." },

      { question: "Will the download exceed 500KB?", answer: "The compressor looks for a result at or below the target. Its exact size varies with the source image and browser encoding." },
      { question: "Is 500KB suitable for an email attachment?", answer: "Usually, yes. It is substantially lighter than many camera originals, though sending several images will increase the total message size." },
